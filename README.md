<H1>A Single page Web application developing Framework.</h1>
<p>This is a simple framework for desigining single page web applications, using only html and javascript (minor), 
so no need to learn any other extra language, thats why it is a good way for develping for begeneers.
<br>
Project started on 15 June, 2021, and Project is still under devlopment.
</p>
<p>So, i can't get name for my project till now thats why this repo such odd name.</p>

<p>
Note: Till now project uses python only for creating project files and directories, python is not used here as a backend here, if you want to use python in backend you can directly use django here.
